    For over twenty years, Mike Counsil has played a key role in Santa Clara
    Valley’s service industry. As a contractor, he initially focused on
    residential and commercial construction where he earned a reputation for
    professionalism and attention to detail. Five years later, Mike added
    residential to his roster of services. After extensive research, he chose
    the Maio System—a proven resource for building a business that aligned with
    his focus on serving the community. In the late nineties, his wife Brenda
    joined what is still a family-owned and operated company.For the next
    several years, Mike Counsil Plumbing enjoyed strong growth. Unfortunately,
    this success was marred by personal tragedy when the Counsil’s lost their
    youngest son in a car accident. During this difficult time, the business was
    maintained through dedication and hard work. In 2010, after reviewing a
    variety of programs, Mike joined PSI, a leader in talent training, licensing
    and certification. With a rigorous focus on constant improvement, the
    business soon doubled in annual sales and personnel. In present time, Mike
    added an innovative agile management system to ensure projects are completed
    on time and within budget. Mike continues to strategize, test, and implement
    new ideas to constantly improve the customer experience. He remains closely
    involved with the company he founded over twenty years ago, a company still
    dedicated to serving the community while maintaining a family-oriented
    culture.

- name: Sean Counsil 
  job_title: Operations Manager

    As a young kid, Sean had the opportunity to work with his father Mike
    Counsil on many construction sites during the summer months. These hard work
    values early on would prove to be beneficial in shaping his future. After
    High School, Sean was destined to create his own career outside the family
    plumbing business and attended College for a couple of years. By the end of
    the year in 2000 the opportunities in the family business became to
    favorable. Sean was a Service Technician for Mike Counsil Plumbing from
    2001-2011. Through this decade of service he built long lasting and
    meaningful relationships with hundreds of clients. He took great pride in
    being neat, thorough, and personable while working in people's homes. As a
    result he had a long list of customer's calling in asking for him.
    Delivering the ultimate plumbing experience to MCP's clients advanced him to
    his current role as Operations Manager. As Operations Manager Sean enjoys
    training all field members. His number one priority is training his service
    technicians daily on attitude, people/human relations skills and effective
    communication. The company believes plumbers trained and taught in these key
    areas will result in continued personable relationships with their client's
    for years to come. Oddly enough, Sean doesn't really view himself as a
    manager per say. He prefers titles such as teacher, trainer, or coach. We
    say call him what you may . As long as you keep calling Us!

- name: Glenn Hammonds 
  job_title: Field Supervisor
  content: |
    As a young man my father had an appliance shop, so I grew up working on
    appliances and dealing with people regarding their appliance needs. Some
    time later I wanted to learn a different trade so I began learning plumbing
    during high school summer vacations. My plumbing experience began on
    commercial job sites, where I did installations of plumbing systems in
    homes. I did this for several years and became very proficient at plumbing
    in all situations. The new construction industry slowed down and I wanted
    to continue my career in plumbing, so I applied for a job at Mike Counsil
    Plumbing and Electric. I have earned my way to the positions of "Field
    Supervisor" and enjoy my job and helping clients with their plumbng
    challenges.
